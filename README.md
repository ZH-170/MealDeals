## The Problem We're Solving 💸

Ever stare into your fridge, wondering what to cook, while your grocery budget feels tighter than ever? We've all been there. Trying to eat well, save money, and get creative in the kitchen can feel like three different, impossible tasks. Scrolling through multiple supermarket apps for discounts and then brainstorming a meal from those scattered ingredients is a chore.

## Our Solution: A Smarter Way to Save and Cook 🤖

**MealDeals** is the solution to this modern-day dilemma. We've built an intelligent web app that does the hard work for you. By scraping daily discounts from Sydney's biggest supermarkets (Woolworths, Coles, Aldi, and IGA), we give you a real-time list of what's on sale. But we don't stop there. We use an AI model to take those ingredients and generate delicious, personalized recipes, complete with cooking instructions and nutritional info.

It's not just a grocery list—it's a meal plan powered by savings.
